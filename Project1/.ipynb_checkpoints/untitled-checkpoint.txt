We can see roughly from the summary diagram of each of the prediction scores and the information gains, that a **high accuracy** corresponds normally to high total/average/max information gain.
This is generally true except for two special cases. 
The first special case is the breast-cancer dataset. This dataset have a 0.76 accuracy, not too bad, but have very low information gain throughout all columns.
After brief examination of the dataset and confusion matrix, we can see the dataset have only two classes one of which taked upto 73% instances of the whole dataset. Meaning a Zero-R baseline will achieve 73% accuracy (i.e. with only the prior distribution), and our 76% accuracy is not much better than this baseline. This explains why with such low information gain the classifier still achieved moderatly high accuracy.
The second exception is the primary-tumor dataset, where exactly the opposite happens, we have very high information gain accompanied with a low accuracy.
